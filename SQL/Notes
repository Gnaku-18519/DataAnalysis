A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed.
DBMS = Database Management System
    1. Relational (RDBMS): store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships
                   SQL -- Structured Query Language
    2. Non-SQL: no tables or relationships, don't understand SQL
    
VARCHAR(50) & CHAR(50) -> if the text has only 5 characters, then actual VARCHAR() = 5, but CHAR() will still be 50 (with auto-filled spaces)

PK - Primary Key
NN - Not Null
BIN - BINary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)
UN - UNsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
UQ - UniQue key (create or remove)
ZF - Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0’s to the 5th digit. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )
AI - Auto Increment
G - Generated column, i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns

Foreign Key: a column or set of columns that allow us to establish a referential link between the data in two tables
             -> helps to match the foreign key column data with the data of the referenced table data
             -> the referenced table is called the parent table and the table that involves a foreign key is called the child table
             -> if a foreign key references another column of the same table, this reference type is called a self-reference
