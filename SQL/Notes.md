A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed.
DBMS = Database Management System
    1. Relational (RDBMS): store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships
                   SQL -- Structured Query Language
    2. Non-SQL: no tables or relationships, don't understand SQL
    
VARCHAR(50) & CHAR(50) -> if the text has only 5 characters, then actual VARCHAR() = 5, but CHAR() will still be 50 (with auto-filled spaces)

PK - Primary Key
NN - Not Null
BIN - BINary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)
UN - UNsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
UQ - UniQue key (create or remove)
ZF - Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0â€™s to the 5th digit. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )
AI - Auto Increment
G - Generated column, i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns

Foreign Key: a column or set of columns that allow us to establish a referential link between the data in two tables
             -> helps to match the foreign key column data with the data of the referenced table data
             -> the referenced table is called the parent table and the table that involves a foreign key is called the child table
             -> if a foreign key references another column of the same table, this reference type is called a self-reference

Inner Join                                                                      | Outer Join                                                                             
Only matching common records or values from both the database tables            | All the records from the database tables are taken (no require for common ID)
All rows will have real value                                                   | Some entries may return a null value
No alternatives or variants                                                     | Outer join can be left, right, or full join
Optimizer can be used as it gives many valuable options                         | Optimizer use limited as the joins take all the entries (not practical)
Have the least entries and will be able to update the user requirements         | Usage must be monitored and checked thoroughly
Slower                                                                          | (Especially left outer joins) faster and better performance in most cases
Conditions are mandatory to be satisfied                                        | No conditions that we have to meet necessarily
No output of those entries having no matching with the entries of another table | Get null if entries of one table do not have any matching with another table
Straightforward process (matching not be considered for left or right tables)   | Check either condition is given for left or right tables 
                                                                                |     and entry is considered accordingly except full outer join
Recommended if a related data entry is needed                                   | More suitable for the others
    as per the customer requirement or database design                          |
